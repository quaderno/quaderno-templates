# Quaderno Templates

Quaderno allows you to customize all your documents, whether they're invoices, refunds, or estimates, as well as any email sent to your customers. We achieve this through Quaderno Templates, a template engine based on the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) language, offering our own additional variables, tags, and filters.
